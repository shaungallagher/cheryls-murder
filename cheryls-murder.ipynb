Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates:\n    \n>     May     15  16  19\n>     June    17  18\n>     July    14  16\n>     August  14  15  17\n\n> Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively.\n\n> **Albert:**  I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too.\n\n> **Bernard:**  At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.\n\n> **Albert:**  Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.\n\n> So, when is Cheryl's birthday?\n\nIt is possible to arrive at the solution by systematically eliminating all but one of the possible dates using the information Albert and Bernard have provided.\n\nOne of the difficult things about this problem is that it requires you to maintain a mental model about what each person does and doesn't know (as well as what he could and couldn't know) at any point in time.\n\nIn this post, I'm going to present a new twist on the Cheryl's Birthday problem: a murder mystery.\n\nFirst, I'll give you the problem so you can try to solve it yourself.  Next, I'll describe how I used code to generate the problem.  Then, I'll show you how I used code to solve the problem.  Finally, I'll offer some statistics about how often the generated puzzles result in interesting (or solvable) scenarios.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Cheryl's Murder\n\nWhen Cheryl grew up, she became a remarkably successful venture capitalist.  To celebrate her 40th birthday, she invited 13 of her closest friends to spend the weekend at her beachfront mansion.  Saturday evening, while her guests were partying on the first floor, Cheryl excused herself and walked to her room on the second floor.  A few minutes later, her three maids, who were in different rooms upstairs, each heard Cheryl scream.\n\nThe first maid, Zoey, got to Cheryl's room and found Cheryl on the floor, stabbed in the stomach.  Cheryl whispered a name to her, and then Zoey ran to get help.  The second maid, Yvonne, ran into the room next and found Cheryl.  Cheryl whispered something to her -- an article of clothing -- and then Yvonne, too, ran to get help.  Finally, the third maid, Ximena, ran into the room.  To Ximena, Cheryl was able to whisper one final word -- an occupation -- and then she breathed her last.\n\nAn hour later, Detective Kenneth Kong arrived at the mansion and interviewed the three maids.  They explained that Cheryl had whispered a word to each of them, and it appeared that the words pointed to the party guest who stabbed her.\n\nHere is the list of guests who attended Cheryl's birthday party:\n\n* Albert, a dancer, who wore a ball cap\n* Albert, an artist, who wore a ball cap\n* Albert, an engineer, who wore an earring\n* Bernard, a bricklayer, who wore a ball cap\n* Bernard, an artist, who wore cuff links\n* Bernard, a dancer, who wore dungarees\n* Charles, a dancer, who wore an earring\n* Charles, a chef, who wore an ascot\n* Daniel, an engineer, who wore an ascot\n* Daniel, an artist, who wore an ascot\n* Daniel, a bricklayer, who wore an ascot\n* Daniel, an artist, who wore cuff links\n* Edward, an engineer, who wore an earring\n\nAnd here is the transcript of Detective Kong's interview with the three maids:\n\n> **Detective:**  So ... what can you tell me? \n\n> **Zoey**:  I don't know who did it.\n\n> **Yyvonne**:  I don't know who did it.\n\n> **Ximena**:  I don't know who did it.\n\n> **Zoey:**  I still don't know who did it.\n\n> **Yyvonne:**  I still don't know who did it.\n\n> **Ximena**:  I still don't know who did it.\n\n> **Zoey:**  I still don't know who did it.\n\n> **Yyvonne:**  I know who did it!\n\n> **Ximena:**  I know who did it!\n\n> **Zoey:**  I know who did it!\n\nDetective Kong didn't wait for them to tell him the name of the person they suspected.  He raced into the ballroom, where the 13 party guests were gathered, and arrested the culprit.\n\nSo ... whom did the detective arrest?", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Generating the guest list\n\nWe've got five different names, five articles of clothing, and five occupations.

the Cheryl's Murder mystery also solve the original Cheryl's Birthday problem?\n\nYes, but some modifications are needed.\n\nAt the beginning of the Cheryl's Birthday exchange, Albert says that 1) he himself doesn't know her birthday, and 2) Bernard couldn't possibly know her birthday either.  So, he's making a statement not only about what he knows, but also about what he knows that someone else can know.\n\nHow does Albert know that Bernard could not know Cheryl's birthday?  It's because he knows the correct month, and each of the day values associated with that month is associated with at least one other month. Thus, no matter what day Bernard has been told, he does not have enough information to figure out the correct month.\n\nTo work this into our `generate_transcript` function, we need to first determine whether each of the possible values a fellow confidant might have been given is an ambiguous value -- that is, it is associated with more than one suspect.  If so, we can broadcast the fact that we know that the confidant could not know who the guilty party is.  Then, upon receiving that information, we can work backward and eliminate any suspects whose values don't meet that condition.\n\nWe'll broadcast the information by adding a new attribute to each `confidant` object: `could_know_guilty`, which differs from `knows_guilty` because it indicates only the *possibility* that the person knows, not the certainty.\n", "cell_type": "markdown",

Days project at [Monetate](http://www.monetate.com).  Twice a year, all of the software engineers at our company are given several days to work on a project of their choosing.  It's a great way for us to try out new technologies and strengthen our programming chops.  [Learn more about working at Monetate](http://www.monetate.com/about/careers/)\n\nThe code above uses two means of deduction to narrow down the suspects list.\n\nThe first assumes that if a confidant has stated that she does not know who the murderer is, we can rule out any of the remaining suspects who is the only person to have an attribute that the confidant knows about, because otherwise the confidant would be able to determine the murderer's identity based on that information, and thus would not have said that she does not know who the murderer is.\n\nThe second method is sort of the inverse of the first.  It assumes that if a confidant has stated that she knows who the murderer is, then only the remaining suspects who are the only ones to have an attribute that the confidant knows about could be the murderer, and we can rule out everybody else.\n\nThere may very well be other methods to rule out certain suspects; if you know of any, I'd be interested to learn about them (and perhaps incorporate them into my puzzle-solving script).\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering about the example puzzle that I used above to introduce the Cheryl's Murder mystery, the guest whom Detective Kong arrested
